Turning a legacy ADNS-2610 mouse sensor into a low-res CMOS camera using Arduino and Python.
ADNS-2610 Optical Mouse Sensor Camera
This project demonstrates how to repurpose a legacy ADNS-2610 optical mouse sensor into a low-resolution ($18 \times 18$ pixel) digital camera. Using an Arduino UNO to interface with the sensor's serial registers and Python for real-time visualization, we can "see" the microscopic world the mouse uses for navigation.
